## Technologies Used
**Kotlin:** Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.
**Navigation Component:** Implements a single activity with multiple fragments to streamline navigation.
**Retrofit:** Facilitates HTTP connections with REST APIs and converts meal JSON files into Kotlin/Java objects.
**Room Database:** Stores pokemon to pokedex(favorite pokemon) in a local database for efficient data management.
**MVVM & LiveData:** Segregates logic code from views and maintains state, particularly useful for handling screen configuration changes.
**Coroutines:** Executes background tasks to ensure smooth performance.
**View Binding:** Simplifies view inflation, improving code readability and maintenance.
**Glide:** Efficiently caches and loads images into ImageViews for an enhanced visual experience.
**Pagination:** The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over a network. This approach lets your app use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.
