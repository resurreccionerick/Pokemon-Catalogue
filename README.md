## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin:** A modern, statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers. It boosts productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.
- **Navigation Component:** Implements a single activity with multiple fragments to streamline navigation.
- **Retrofit:** Facilitates HTTP connections with REST APIs and converts JSON responses into Kotlin/Java objects.
- **Room Database:** Stores Pokémon in a local database for efficient data management, allowing users to save their favorite Pokémon to their Pokédex.
- **MVVM & LiveData:** Segregates logic code from views and maintains state, particularly useful for handling screen configuration changes.
- **Coroutines:** Executes background tasks to ensure smooth performance.
- **View Binding:** Simplifies view inflation, improving code readability and maintenance.
- **Glide:** Efficiently caches and loads images into ImageViews for an enhanced visual experience.
- **Pagination:** The Paging library helps load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over a network, using network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.
